/**
 * If the application is redeployed, this is done by setting a symlink to
 * the newly installed version. The old project directory is still retained
 * to enable a rollback. After redeploying the application, all running
 * Massenger workers are invalid and must be stopped.
 *
 * To recognize this, a file is stored in the cache directory of the project
 * in which a random hash value is saved. The `WorkerRunningEvent` is used to
 * check whether the file still exists in the project cache directory and
 * whether it contains the expected hash value. If this is not the case, the
 * project directory has changed and the worker is stopped.
 *
 * The worker is restarted via a process manager such as
 * [Supervisor](http://supervisord.org/), which monitors the process and also
 * restarts it if the process has been stopped. The worker process is
 * then restarted for the newly deployed project.
